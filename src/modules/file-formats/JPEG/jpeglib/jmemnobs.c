 * This file provides a really simple implementation of the system-
 * dependent portion of the JPEG memory manager.  This implementation
 * assumes that no backing-store files are needed: all required space
 * can be obtained from malloc().
 * This is very portable in the sense that it'll compile on almost anything,
 * but you'd better have lots of main memory (or virtual memory) if you want
 * to process big images.
 * Note that the max_memory_to_use option is respected by this implementation.
