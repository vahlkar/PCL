 * \class SettingsData
 * \brief Serializable, thread-safe settings data.
 *
 * This class implements a specialized dictionary for fast indexed access to
 * key/value pairs with persistent storage in special per-instance XML files.
 *
 * The main access functions provided by this class to add, get and find
 * settings values, as well as to clear, load and save the settings and query
 * object properties, are implemented as thread-safe routines. This supports
 * applications performing parallel settings access and disk I/O operations, as
 * well as multiple application instances running concurrently.
 *
 * Settings files are generated and managed transparently on platform-dependent
 * configuration directories.
